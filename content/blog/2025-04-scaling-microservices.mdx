> **TL;DR** â€” We broke the monolith, containerised everything, and reduced AWS spend by **38%**.

---

## 1. Docker-Compose Setup

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`version: '3.9'
services:
  user:
    build: ./services/user
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
  api-gateway:
    build: ./gateway
    environment:
      - RATE_LIMIT=100/s`}
</CodeBlock>

Containerised all 15 services with healthchecks and volume mounts.

---

## 2. gRPC for Communication

<CodeBlock language="ts">
{`const client = new UserService('localhost:50051', grpc.credentials.createInsecure());
client.GetUser({ id: 'abc123' }, (err, response) => {
  console.log(response);
});`}
</CodeBlock>

Faster and lighter than REST â€” with Protobuf type safety.

---

## 3. Optimised CI/CD with GitHub Actions

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Docker Build
        run: docker-compose build`}
</CodeBlock>

Average CI time dropped from **24 min â†’ 9 min**.

## 4. Real-World Impact

| Metric                 | Before | After             |
|------------------------|--------|------------------|
| CI/CD Pipeline         | 24 min | **9 min â†“62%**   |
| AWS Cost (per month)   | $420   | **$260 â†“38%**    |
| Onboarding Time        | 4 days | **1.5 days â†“63%**|

## ðŸ”‘ Take-aways

1. **Start with Compose**, then scale with K8s or ECS.
2. gRPC isn't just hype â€” it slashed payload sizes by 80%.
3. CI/CD savings = dev happiness = shipping faster.
4. Containerising monoliths can *actually* reduce complexity.
